    Build and deploy your apps in minutes. Tell us where to find your code, and let App Studio do the rest.
    Here are some possible sources for your code:
    1. **GitHub repository**
       App Studio can build apps written in the following languages: Python, Java, Go, and Node.js.
       To get started, add a URL of your GitHub repo. Then, we’ll fetch your code, build a container image for you, and deploy it.
    1. **Quay container image**
       App Studio can use an existing image you already have stored in the Quay container registry. The advantage of an image is that you can code in any language and use any container image type,
       App Studio will deploy it for you to the Development environment.
    1. **Sample code**
       Try one of our samples to explore App Studio. Samples are great ways to test out different languages in App Studio.
    Once you add your code, you can edit deployment settings, for example, a target port or environment variables. You can always change them later.
    When everything looks good, click **Create**. Your app will automatically be deployed to the Development environment that is included with this Service Preview.

  title: Manage your apps

    As you build and scale your app, this view shows everything you need to know about your app and components in one place.
    - **Components**
      You’ll discover a list of your components, their build statuses, and logs in a single view. We keep an eye on components built from your GitHub code and rebuild them whenever you change the source code.
      From the **Actions menu**, you can tweak the settings, such as port value, at any time for each component.
      Changing global settings of any component overrides global settings across all the environments.
      Changing build settings only affects one component.
    - **Environments**
      Your source code is automatically built and deployed to the Development environment that comes with your service preview. You can change the deployment settings for each component as you scale your app across environments from the **Actions menu**.
