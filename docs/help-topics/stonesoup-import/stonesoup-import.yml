    A “component” is an image that we build from source code in a repository. An application is a collection of these components working together. To start building your application, add a component by importing your code repository, or use one of our samples.

    **Using code from your GitHub repository**
    1. To use your own code, enter the link to your repository in the **Git repo URL** field. We verify your URL right away. You don’t even have to press **Enter**.
    2. Click **Git options** to expand it and choose whether to make either of the following specifications:
        1. Add a **Git reference** to point to code in a specific branch, tag, or commit that you want to use to build your application.
        2. Indicate a **Context dir** to specify the subdirectory for the source code you want to use.
    3. Click **Import code**, then we scan and analyze your Git directory to determine how many components to add to your application. The types of files in your repository, and also your Git directory file hierarchy, determine the number and type of components to add. For example, we look for devfiles and Dockerfiles, and language-specific build configuration files like pom.xml for Java or package.json for Node.js.

    ***
    **NOTE**
    
    We can build applications that are written in the following language stacks and frameworks:

    * Python
    * Java
    * Go
    * .NET
    * Node.js
    * Quarkus
    * Spring Boot

    ***
    **Using a code sample**
    To start with a code sample, in the code sample **Search** field, enter the name of the code you want to work with, or click **Import sample** on any of the options displayed. Follow the resulting instructions to explore or test whatever language and framework you choose.

  title: Configure components
  content: |-
    We analyze your code, then define and apply deployment settings for each of your application components. Remember, a “component” is an image that we build from source code in a repository. An application is a collection of these components working together.

    Before you create and deploy your application, look over the values and options that display here. You can rename any component from this view, too. 

    - **Component name**: Is it correct? Click the GitHub link under this field if you want to check your repository URL.
    - **Runtime**: Did we detect the right one? If so, you should notice that we suggest appropriate deployment options. If you want to change your runtime, expand the menu next to your runtime name and make a selection.

    In the **Build & deploy configuration** section, look over these items:
    - **Target port**: Is it correct? If not, click in the field to modify it.
    - **Dockerfile**: If you specified **Dockerfile** as your runtime, make sure we detected the right one. Click in the field if you need to modify it. Don't worry! We hide this field if you chose a different runtime.
    - **Default build pipeline**: To specify how to trigger rebuilds, toggle to choose either the default build pipeline or a custom one.
        - **Default build pipeline**: This runs faster because it makes only critical image checks. Consider starting here to make sure we can successfully build and deploy your component.
        - **Custom build pipeline**: This is triggered when you make commits to your source code repository. This pipeline runs more checks and security scans than the default pipeline, but it takes a bit more time because it's more thorough. **NOTE:** To use a custom pipeline, you must be the owner of your repository so that you can authorize the installation of our application in your GitHub instance and then grant the app access to your repository. If someone else owns your repository, fork it, then go back to the Add components page and start again.
    - **CPU** and **Memory**: Choose how many of each of these you want for your application, and in what unit, depending on your deployment requirements.
    
    In the **Environment variables** section, enter a variable name and value to customize how we deploy your application. 

    When you’re satisfied with your component configuration settings, click **Create application**. 

    ***
    **NOTE**

    After you create your application, you can adjust your configuration settings anytime you want from the **Application** view.
