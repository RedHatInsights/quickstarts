  prerequisites:
    - You must have a ROSA or an OSD cluster.
    - You must be a cluster owner, cluster editor, or Organization Administrator for the cluster.

  description: |-
    Manage a notification contact for your existing managed OpenShift cluster.

  introduction: |-
    By default, when a cluster notification is sent to the cluster, it is also sent as an email to you as the cluster owner.

    You can add users in your organization as additional notification contacts to receive cluster notifications. The Red Hat username or email address that you provide must belong to a user account in the Red Hat organization where the cluster is deployed.

    [In this quickstart, when we refer to ROSA, we are referring to both ROSA (classic architecture) and ROSA with HCP, and when we refer to OSD, we are referring to both OSD on GCP and OSD on AWS.]{{admonition note}}
