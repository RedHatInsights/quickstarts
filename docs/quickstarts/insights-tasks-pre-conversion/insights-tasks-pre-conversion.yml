      description: |-
        [Back up your systems and verify that you can restore them if needed.]{{admonition important}}
        
        To assess whether you can convert a CentOS Linux 7 system to RHEL, run the “Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL” task. The pre-conversion analysis generates a report summarizing potential problems and recommending solutions. The report also helps you decide whether it is possible or advisable to convert to RHEL.<br>       
        
        1. Go to **Red Hat Insights > RHEL > Automation Toolkit > Tasks.**
      
        1. Locate the **Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL** task and click **Select systems.**

        1. You can change the task name. It will be used on the report generated. 

        1. Select the CentOS Linux 7 systems you want to analyze for conversion and click **Next.**
          <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbsp**Don't see your system?**</span></summary>
            <br>
            CentOS Linux 7 systems that appeared correctly in the Insights Inventory might not appear in the list of available systems for the pre-conversion analysis.<br>
            <br>
            This issue occurs when the Remote Host Configuration (RHC)  is disconnected. To fix this issue, complete the following steps:

            - Go to **Red Hat Insights > RHEL > Inventory > Systems.**
            
            - Select the affected system from the table.
            
            - In the **General Information** tab, go to the **System status** card and verify the RHC status:

                -  If the RHC status is **Connected**, RHC is connected correctly

                -  If the RHC status is **Not available**, RHC is disconnected. Proceed to the next step to reconnect RHC.
            
            - Unregister the system in your terminal:<br>
              ```
              # insights-client --unregister
              ```{{copy}}
              <br>
              ```
              # rhc disconnect
              ```{{copy}}
          
            - To help with troubleshooting, set the RHC systemd service (rhcd) logging to the highest level:<br>
              ```
              # sed -ie 's%error%trace%' /etc/rhc/config.toml
              ```{{copy}}
            
            - Register your system with Red Hat Insights and re-enable RHC in your terminal:<br>
              ```
              # insights-client --register
              ```{{copy}}
              <br>
              ```
              # rhc connect -a <activation_key> -o <organization_ID>
              ```{{copy}}
          
            - Verify that you can now select the system in the Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL task.
            
            - Review error messages from rhcd and the **insights-client** tool if the system still does not appear.<br>
              ```
              # journalctl -u read
              ```{{copy}}
              <br>
              ```
              # less /var/log/insights-client/insights-client.log
              ```{{copy}}
             
          </details>
        1. Configure the pre-conversion analysis task with the given settings, as required.
          <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbsp**Configurable task settings**</span></summary>
            - **Do not use the ELS subscription**<br>
              Choose this option if you plan to upgrade your RHEL system to version 8 or higher.
            - **Allow kernel modules outside of RHEL repositories on the system**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore kernel modules that are not part of RHEL repositories.
            - **Allow outdated kernel on the system**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore when your system is booted from an outdated kernel.
            - **Allow outdated packages on the system**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore all outdated packages on the system.
            - **Allow tainted kernel modules**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore tainted kernel modules.
            - **Enable non-default RHEL repositories**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to install packages from the listed non-default RHEL repositories.
          </details>
        1. Click **Run Task** to start the pre-conversion task on the selected systems.
        1. Go to the **Activity** tab and find the newly running conversion task. Your task shows a run status of "Running" until it finishes for all included systems. At that time, the run status will update to "Completed."

    - title: Review the pre-conversion analysis report
      description: |-
        1. The pre-conversion analysis utility generates a new report in the **Activity** tab. Select the report to view a summary of issues found in each system.

        1. After task completion, you can drill down further by selecting a system to view each issue and, when applicable, a potential remediation in detail.<br>
        <br>
        Each issue is assigned a severity level:         
              - **Inhibitor:** Would cause the conversion to fail because it is very likely to result in a deteriorated system state. This issue must be resolved before converting.
              - **Overridable inhibitor**: Would cause the conversion to fail because it is very likely to result in a deteriorated system state. This issue must be resolved or manually overridden before converting.
              - **Skipped:** This test could not be run because a prerequisite test failed, which could cause the conversion to fail.
              - **Warning:** Would not cause the conversion to fail. System and application issues might occur after the conversion.
              - **Info:** Informational with no expected impact to the system or applications.
              - **Ready for conversion:** No issues were found.

            <br>
            After running the Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL task, one or more systems can fail to generate a report with the error message “Task failed to complete for an unknown reason.” Retry this task at a later time. If this issue occurs, complete the following steps to troubleshoot:

            - Verify if the affected system is unavailable, for example, because of a network accessibility issue or because the system is shut off.
            
            - Review the RHC systemd service (rhcd) for errors:
                - Stop rhcd in your terminal:<br>
                ```
                # systemctl stop rhcd
                ```{{copy}}
                
                - Set the RHC systemd service (rhcd) logging to the highest level:<br>
                ```
                # sed -ie 's%error%trace%' /etc/rhc/config.toml
                ```{{copy}}
                
                - Restart rhcd:<br>
                ```
                # systemctl start rhcd
                ```{{copy}}
                
                - Review error messages posted by rhcd:<br>
                ```
                # journalctl -u rhcd
                ```{{copy}}
                
            - Review the **rhc-worker-script** log file for errors:<br>
            ```
            # less /var/log/rhc-worker-script/rhc-worker-script.log
            ```{{copy}}
          </details> 

        1. After reviewing the report and resolving all reported issues, click **Run task again** to rerun the analysis and confirm that no issues are outstanding.

        1. Convert to RHEL with the “Convert to RHEL from CentOS Linux 7” task or the command-line interface.
