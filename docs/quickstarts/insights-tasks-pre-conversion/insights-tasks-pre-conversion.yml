        [The only Red Hat Insights service you can use with registered CentOS Linux systems is the RHEL conversion. All other Insights services are available only after the conversion to RHEL.]{{admonition note}} 

        Before running the pre-conversion analysis in Red Hat Insights, you must connect your CentOS machines to Insights<br>  
        
        **To verify CentOS Linux machines are connected:**

        1. Connect CentOS Linux machines to Insights.
          <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbsp**Need to connect a CentOS Linux machine?**</span></summary>
            - These commands assume root access. You may also use `sudo` command.
            - Install the Red Hat client tools:
                - Download the Red Hat GPG key:<br>

        [Back up your systems and verify that you can restore your systems if needed]{{admonition important}}
        To assess whether your CentOS Linux systems can be converted to RHEL, run the Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL task. The pre-conversion analysis generates a report summarizing potential problems and recommending solutions. The report also helps you decide whether it is possible or advisable to convert to RHEL.<br>       
        
        **Run a Pre-Conversion analysis:**

        1. Log in to the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console and go to **Red Hat Insights > RHEL > Automation toolkit > Tasks.**

        1. Click the **Preview toggle** to turn on preview mode.
        
        1. Locate the **Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL** task and click **Run task.**

        1. Select the CentOS Linux 7 systems you want to analyze for conversion and click **Execute task.**
          <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbsp**Don't see your system?**</span></summary>
            <br>
            CentOS Linux 7 systems that appeared correctly in the Insights Inventory might not appear in the list of available systems on which to run the pre-conversion analysis.<br>
            <br>
            This issue occurs when the Remote Host Configuration (RHC)  is disconnected. To fix this issue, complete the following steps:

            - Log in to the [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console](http://console.redhat.com) and go to **Red Hat Insights > RHEL > Inventory > Systems**
            
            - Select the affected system from the table.
            
            - In the **General Information** tab, go to the **System Status** card and verify the RHC status:

                -  If the RHC status is **Connected**, RHC is connected correctly

                -  If the RHC status is **Not available**, RHC is disconnected. Proceed to the next step to reconnect RHC.
            
            - Unregister the system in your terminal:<br>
            `# insights-client --unregister`{{copy}}<br>
            `# rhc disconnect`{{copy}}<br>
          
            - To help with troubleshooting, set the RHC systemd service (rhcd) logging to the highest level:<br>
            `# sed -ie 's%error%trace%' /etc/rhc/config.toml`{{copy}}<br>
            
            - Register your system with Red Hat Insights and re-enable RHC in your terminal:<br>
            `# insights-client --register`{{copy}}<br>
            `# rhc connect -a <activation_key> -o <organization_ID>`{{copy}}<br>
          
            - Verify that you can select the system in the Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL task.
            
            If the system still does not appear correctly, review error messages from rhcd and the **insights-client** tool.<br>
            `# journalctl -u read`{{copy}}<br>
            `# less /var/log/insights-client/insights-client.log`{{copy}}<br>
             
          </details>
 
        1. The pre-conversion analysis utility generates a new report in the **Activity tab**. Click the report to view a summary of issues found in each system. 

        1. After task completion, you can drill down further by selecting a system to view each issue and, when applicable, a potential remediation in detail.<br>
        <br>
        Each issue is assigned a severity level:         
              - **Inhibitor:** This would cause the conversion to fail because it will likely result in a deteriorated system state. This issue must be resolved before converting.
              - **Overridable inhibitor**: This would cause the conversion to fail because it will likely result in a deteriorated system state. This issue must be resolved or manually overridden before converting.
              Skipped: The test could not run because of a prerequisite test failing. This issue could cause the conversion to fail.
              - **Warning:** This would not cause the conversion to fail. System and application issues might occur after the conversion.
              - **Info:** Informational with no expected impact to the system or applications.
        
          <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbsp**Why did the Pre-conversion analysis task fail to complete?**</span></summary>
            <br>
            After running the Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL task, one or more systems can fail to generate a report with the error message Task failed to complete for an unknown reason. Retry this task at a later time. If this issue occurs, complete the following steps to troubleshoot:

            - Verify if the affected system is unavailable, for example, because of a network accessibility issue or because the system is shut off.
            
            - Review the RHC systemd service (rhcd) for errors:
                - Stop rhcd in your terminal:<br>
                `# systemctl stop rhcd`{{copy}}<br>
                
                - Set the RHC systemd service (rhcd) logging to the highest level:<br>
                `# sed -ie 's%error%trace%' /etc/rhc/config.toml`{{copy}}<br>
                
                - Restart rhcd:<br>
                `# systemctl start rhcd`{{copy}}<br>
                
                - Review error messages posted by rhcd:<br>
                `# journalctl -u rhcd`{{copy}}<br>
                
            - Review the **rhc-worker-script** log file for errors:<br>
            `# less /var/log/rhc-worker-script/rhc-worker-script.log`{{copy}}<br>
            
          </details> 

        1. After reviewing the report and resolving all reported issues, click **Run task again** to rerun the analysis and confirm that no issues are outstanding.

        1. Perform the conversion to RHEL in the command-line interface. See [Converting a RHEL system](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/converting_from_an_rpm-based_linux_distribution_to_rhel/proc_converting-to-a-rhel-system_converting-from-a-linux-distribution-to-rhel) for more information.   

        [It is not currently possible to perform the conversion to RHEL using Red Hat Insights.]{{admonition note}}
