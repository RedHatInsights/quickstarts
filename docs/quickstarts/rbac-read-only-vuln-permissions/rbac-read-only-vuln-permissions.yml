    - Users whom you want to limit permissions to read-only for a service

    Limiting access to the vulnerability service to read-only for specific users 
  introduction: |-
    This quick start shows you how to assign read-only permissions to certain users for a particular service in the Hybrid Cloud Console (the console). 

    You can use this workflow when you don’t want certain teams or members to make changes in your environment – for example, if you want your security team to be able to view security Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems and generate vulnerability reports, but they don’t need to edit resources or take action.

    To give these users read-only permissions to a service, you’ll remove Administrator and Editor roles from the default configuration in **User Access**, and assign the members of your security team the **Vulnerability Viewer** role.

    Generally, read-only permissions in the console are provided by Viewer roles in **User Access**, while execute permissions to create or update resources are provided by Administrator, Editor, and User roles.

    You can also use this example workflow to customize access to services within **User Access** and modify the **Default Access** group. 

  tasks:
    - title: Removing edit roles from the **Default access** group
      description: |-
        Edit the **Default access** group and remove the roles that you don’t want all users to have. (If the **Default access** group was previously modified, then it’s called the **Custom default access** group.)
        
        For this example, remove all the Administrator, Editor, and User roles from the **Default access** group, so that users in your organization no longer can create and update resources by default.
        
        1. Click **User Access** > **Groups**.
        
        2. Click the **Default access** (or **Custom default access**) group. 
        
        3. In the **Roles** tab,  find the roles that you want to remove from the group and select their checkboxes – in this case, all roles with *Administrator*, *Editor*, or *User* in the name.
        [You can quickly find roles by entering a search term in the *Filter by name* field above the roles list.]{{admonition note}}

        4. Above the **Roles** list, click&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (More options) > **Remove** to remove these permissions from users in the **Default access** group.
        
        5. Click **Remove roles**.

        6. If you are modifying the **Default access** group for the first time, select the checkbox in the warning and click **Continue** to confirm.
        
        Users in your organization now no longer have edit permissions by default. The **Default access** group is now called **Custom default access**, but any user-created group names have not changed.

        [You can undo any changes made to the **Default access** group by clicking **Restore to default** on the **Groups** page.]{{admonition note}}

        instructions: |-
          - Go to **Groups** > **Custom default access** and confirm that the roles you removed are no longer in the list of roles assigned to all users in your organization.

      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
    - title: Creating a group with the **Vulnerability Viewer** role
      description: |-
        Create a new group for your security team with permissions to view CVEs and create vulnerability service reports using the Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) vulnerability service, then assign specific team members to the group. 

        1. Click **Groups** > **Create group**.

        2. Enter a group name (for example, *Security Team*) and description, and click **Next**.

        3. Find and select the **Vulnerability VIewer** role. Click **Next** to add it to the group.
        [You can quickly find a role by filtering by role name.]{{admonition note}}

        4. Add the members of your security team to the group by selecting the checkboxes for those users. Click **Next**.
        [You can quickly find users by filtering by username, email, or status.]{{admonition note}}

        5. Review the group details and click **Submit** to create the group.
        
        Now the users in the *Security Team* group can monitor CVEs for your RHEL systems and generate vulnerability service reports.

      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Go to **User Access** > **Groups** and click *Security Team* to check that the only role assigned to the group is **Vulnerability Viewer**.

        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header

    - title: Creating a group with edit roles
      description: |-
        Create a new group for users who need to manage resources in the console, and add the edit roles you removed from the **Default Access** group. Add any team members to this group who need elevated permissions.
        
        [Some roles, such as User Access administrator and Remediations administrator, have capabilities that you may want to limit to a very small group of employees. It’s a good idea to review the permissions of these roles and others from **User Access** > **Roles** before assigning these roles to a group.]{{admonition note}}

        1. Click **Groups** > **Create group**.

        2. Enter a group name (for example, *Admins*) and description, and click **Next**.

        3. Select the checkbox at the top of the list to add all roles to this group, and click **Next**.

        4. Add any users to the group who need permissions to edit resources. Select the checkboxes for those users and click **Next**.

        5. Review the group details and click **Submit** to create the group.

        You now have a new group called *Admins* that can view and edit resources in the console.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Log in to the console as a member of the *Admins* group, and confirm you can edit a resource (such as the name of an OpenShift cluster).
          - Log in to the console as a user who isn't in the *Admins* group, and confirm you can view resources in the console, but can't edit anything.

        failedTaskHelp: Try completing the steps again.

      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
  
  conclusion: |-
    Congratulations! You’ve now configured read-only permissions to the vulnerability service for selected users in your organization.
    
    After completing this quick start:
    - All users in your organization can view resources and services in the console, but cannot make any changes. 
    - Users in the *Security Team* group can view security-related items resources in the console, such as CVEs, but cannot make any changes.
    - If you created an *Admins* group, these users can manage resources in the console.

    A few tips:
    - User access in the console is additive, meaning that each user has the default access permissions, plus permissions from any other groups they are assigned.
    - You can undo any changes you make to the **Default access** group by clicking **Restore to default** on the **Groups** page.
