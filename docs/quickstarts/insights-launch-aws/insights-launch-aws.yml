    Learn how to add an Amazon Web Service source and launch an image.
  introduction: |-
    Welcome to the quick start for launching an Amazon Web Service image.

    - title: Launch an instance in the AWS environment.
      description: |-  
          Now let’s use our new AWS image to launch an environment from the console.
          <br>

          <h4 id="ib-aws-launch"><b>Launch an instance in the AWS environment:</B></h4>

          1. Navigate to **Images** in the left menu.
          
          1. Locate an image created with an AWS source.
          
              - The image type is displayed in the “Target” column.
          
              - Note: The source must be configured to launch instances. See Add or Edit an AWS Source.
          
          1. From the “Instance” column, click **Launch.**
          
          1. In the "Accounts and Customizations | Amazon" step:
          
              - **Select account:**  “Your source” will be displayed.
          
              - **Select region:** Use the default region, “us-east-1.”
          
              - **Select instance type:** Select “t2.medium.”
          
              - **Count:** Leave the number of instances you want to instantiate at 1. 
          
              - Click **Next.**
          
          1. In the "SSH keys authentication" step:
          
              - Select or enter your own public SSH key for authentication.
          
              - Click **Next.**
          
          1. Review the details and click **Launch.** 
          
          1. Wait for the system to launch the new instances.
          
          1. After the Launch wizard shows the "System(s) launched successfully" message:
              
              - You can either click the Host URL link under ID or save the Host Instance ID link for later reference.
              
              - After you click the link from the Host card, the AWS console screen displays the Instance summary for the launched image.

              - You can find the public IP address that you can use to access the running instance.

              - You can also copy the SSH command to access your instance via SSH in the CLI.

          All launched systems will register with Red Hat and appear in the [Inventory] (https://console.redhat.com/beta/insights/inventory).

          A system's visibility in the console is based on the registration level selection during image creation. We have selected  “Register and connect image instances with Red Hat.” 

          Note that the newly launched instances will take several minutes to show in the inventory.
