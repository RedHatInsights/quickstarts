    Machine pools are an elastic, dynamic provisioning method used on top of your cloud infrastructure.
  introduction: |-
    Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) uses machine pools as an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of your cloud infrastructure.

    A machine pool creates compute machine sets that are all copies of the same configuration across availability zones. Worker nodes in a machine pool are provisioned and managed as a group.

    In this quick start, you'll add a machine pool to your cluster.

    [Each cluster has a default machine pool made during cluster creation. This process adds an additional machine pool to your cluster.]{{admonition note}}

  tasks:
    - title: Add a machine pool to your ROSA cluster
      description: |-
        1. Go to **Cluster List**.
        1. Click your cluster's name.
        1. Click the **Machine pools** tab.
        1. Click the **Add machine pool** button.
        1. Configure your machine pool settings:

            a. Name your machine pool.

            b. Optional: Change any settings you want. These settings are already filled in by default, but you can customize any of them. For more information on what these settings do, click the **?** icon or see [the documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/cluster_administration/manage-nodes-using-machine-pools#creating_machine_pools_ocm_rosa-managing-worker-nodes).

        1. Click **Add machine pool**.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module

        instructions: |-
          - Did you complete the task successfully?
        failedTaskHelp: Try following the steps again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
  conclusion: |-
        Congratulations, you added a machine pool to your cluster!

        After completing this quick start, you've learned how to add a machine pool. Repeat the steps to add more machine pools if you desire.
