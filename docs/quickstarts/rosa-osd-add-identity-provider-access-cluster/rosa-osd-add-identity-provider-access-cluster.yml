  prerequisites:
    - You must have a ROSA or an OSD cluster.
    - You must be a cluster owner or Organization Administrator for the cluster.

  description: |-
    Add an identity provider to your managed OpenShift cluster and access that cluster using the web console.

  introduction: |-
    Both Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) include a built-in OAuth server. Developers and administrators obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API. 
    
    As an administrator, you can configure OAuth to specify an identity provider after you install your cluster. Configuring identity providers allows users to log in and access the cluster using the web console.

    You can configure the following types of identity providers:
    - GitHub or GitHub Enterprise
    - GitLab
    - Google
    - LDAP
    - OpenID Connect
    - htpasswd

    [In this quickstart, when we refer to ROSA, we are referring to both ROSA (classic architecture) and ROSA with HCP, and when we refer to OSD, we are referring to both OSD on GCP and OSD on AWS.]{{admonition note}}

    - title: Add and configure an identity provider for your cluster
      description: |-
        To add an identity provider to your cluster:

        1. Go to **Cluster List**.
        1. Click your cluster's name to view the cluster details.
        1. Click the **Access control** tab.
        1. Click the **Select Add identity provider** tab.
        1. Select your preferred identity provider from the drop-down menu.
        1. Enter a unique name for the identity provider. This name cannot be changed later.
        1. Complete all remaining fields to configure the identity provider.

        To remove an identity provider, click the options icon (â‹®) beside the identity provider you want to remove, and click **Delete**.

  conclusion: |-
        Congratulations, you added and configured an identity provider for your cluster and accessed that cluster through the web console!

        After completing this quick start, you've learned how to add an identity provider to your cluster and access the cluster using this identity provider.
