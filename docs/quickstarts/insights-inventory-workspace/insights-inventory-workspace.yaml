      description: |-

        There are two ways to add systems to a workspace; you can either do it from the workspace's page or from the main Systems page.

        **To add systems to a workspace from the workspace's page:**

        1. From the main Workspaces page, click into a workspace of choice, to navigate to its page.
        1. Click **Add systems** once on the workspace's page. This should open up a modal.
        1. Select systems to add to your workspace using the checkboxes. You may filter through systems using the filter toolbar.
        1. Click **Submit**.

        To add systems to other workspaces, navigate back to the main Workspaces page, click into another workspace and repeat these steps.

        **To add systems to a workspace from the main Systems page:**

        1. Navigate to Inventory > **Systems** using the left navigation.
  
        1. Select systems you want to add to a workspace.
            
            - **To add individual systems to a workspace**, click on <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> in the row level , then click **Add to workspace**.
        
            - **To add multiple systems to a workspace**, select multiple systems using the table checkboxes, Click on <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> in the toolbar, then click on **Add to workspace**.
  
            **NOTE**:  Selecting systems that already belong to a workspace will disable the action. 
  
        1. In the add to workspace modal, you can either select an existing workspace, or create a new workspace (if you have permissions to do so).
    
            - **To add to an existing workspace:**
                1. Select a workspace from the dropdown menu.

            - **To add to a new workspace:**
                1. Click **Create a new workspace**.
                1. Enter a workspace name.
                1. Click **Create**.
