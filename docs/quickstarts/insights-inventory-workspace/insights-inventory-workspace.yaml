  introduction: |-
    
        Welcome to the quick start for creating and managing workspaces. Workspaces provide a flexible, hierarchical approach to organizing your assets and streamline user access.

        In this quick start, you will:
        - Create a workspace.
        - Learn how to add systems to a workspace.
        - Learn how to remove systems from a workspace.
  
  tasks:
    - title: Create a workspace
      description: |- 

        You can create workspaces and select specific systems to add to these workspaces to better organize your Inventory. 

        You can create and manage workspaces both from **RHEL** > **Inventory** > **Workspaces**, or from **Identity & Access Management** > **Workspaces** in the Hybrid Cloud Console.
        
        To create a workspace:

        1. Go to **RHEL** > **Inventory** > **Workspaces** using the left navigation.
        2. Click **Create workspace**.
        3. In the **Create a workspace** dialog:
            - Enter a name for your workspace.
             [Currently, you cannot change the parent workspace. In upcoming releases of this feature, this setting will allow you to configure permissions inheritance.]{{admonition note}}
            - Enter a description for your workspace.
        4. Click **Save**.

        Your new workspace shows in the **Workspaces** list.

          - Is your workspace visible in the **Workspaces** list?
        failedTaskHelp: Try creating your workspace again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header

    - title: Add systems to a workspace
      description: |-

        Assigning your systems to workspaces allows you to configure access control from the workspace level. You can group your systems to fit your organizational structure, limiting permissions to users and systems by workspace.

        You can add systems to a workspace from the workspace details page or from the **Systems** list.

        To add one or more systems to a workspace from the  **Systems** list:

        1. Go to **Inventory** > **Systems**.
        
        2. Select the checkbox for each system(s) you want to add to a workspace.  
  
        3. Add one or more systems to a workspace:

            - To add individual systems to a workspace, click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) in the row, then click **Add to workspace**.

            - To add multiple systems to a workspace, select multiple systems using the checkboxes, click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) in the toolbar, then click **Add to workspace**.
  
           [Selecting systems that already belong to a workspace will disable the action.]{{admonition note}} 

          Click a workspace name to view the systems that belong to that workspace.

          - Does the system you added to a workspace appear on the workspace's page?

      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
      
    - title: Remove systems from a workspace
      description: |- 

        To remove systems from a workspace:

        1. Go to **Inventory** > **Workspaces**.

        2. Select the checkbox for each system(s) you want to remove from a workspace.
            
            - To remove individual systems from a workspace, click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) in the row, then click **Remove from workspace**. 
        
            - To remove multiple systems from a workspace, select multiple systems using the table checkboxes, click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) in the toolbar, then click **Remove from workspace**.

          Click a workspace name to view the systems that belong to that workspace.
