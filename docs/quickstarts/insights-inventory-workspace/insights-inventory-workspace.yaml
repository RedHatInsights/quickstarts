  prerequisites:
    - You are an Organization Administrator or have been granted the Workspace administrator role.
  description: |-
    Learn how to create a workspace, add systems to it, and remove systems from it.
  introduction: |-
    
        Welcome to the quick start for creating and managing workspaces. Workspaces streamline user access in the Hybrid Cloud Console and provide a flexible approach to organizing your assets. 
        
        Configure workspaces to organize systems in your inventory and apply access management rules to them. Use workspace configuration to restrict system access to only those who require it.
        
        In this quick start, you will:
        - Create a workspace.
        - Learn how to add systems to a workspace.
        - Learn how to remove systems from a workspace.
  
  tasks:
    - title: Create a workspace

        Workspaces provide you with an efficient way to organize your systems so that they align with your teams and lines of business. Workspaces give you additional security through role-based access control, making it easier to manage and monitor specific groups of systems based on your organizational needs.

        Create workspaces and then select specific systems to add to these workspaces to better organize your inventory. 

        You can create and manage workspaces from **RHEL** > **Inventory** > **Workspaces**, or from **Identity & Access Management** > **Workspaces** in the console.
        
        To create a workspace:
     
        1. Go to **RHEL** > **Inventory** > **Workspaces**.
        2. Click **Create workspace**.
        3. In the **Create a workspace** dialog, enter a name for your workspace.
        4. Click **Create**.

        Your new workspace is displayed in the **Workspaces** list.

      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header

    - title: Add systems to a workspace
      description: |-

        Assign your systems to workspaces so you can configure access control from the workspace level. You can group your systems to fit your organizational structure, limiting permissions to users and systems by workspace. Each system can belong to only one workspace.

        You can add one or multiple systems to a workspace at a time in one action from the workspace details page or the **Systems** list.

        To add one or more systems to a workspace from the workspace details page:

        1. Go to **RHEL** > **Inventory** > **Workspaces** to see your list of workspaces.

        2. Find your workspace in the list and click the workspace to view its details page.

        3. Click **Add systems**.

        3. Select the checkbox for each system you want to add to a workspace.
            
        4. Click **Add systems**.

            [A system can only belong to one workspace. To reassign a system to a different workspace, remove the system from its current workspace, and then assign it to a new workspace.]{{admonition note}}

        The systems you added are listed on the workspace details page. Click a system to view more details about it, including the workspace it belongs to.

        For more information about configuring inventory and workspaces, see [Viewing and managing system inventory](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_lightspeed/1-latest/html/viewing_and_managing_system_inventory/index).

      description: |- 

        To remove systems from a workspace:

        1. Go to **RHEL** > **Inventory** to see your list of systems and the workspaces they belong to. 

        2. To remove one system from a workspace:

            a. Click the options icon ( <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> ) next to the system, then click **Remove from workspace**. 

            b. Click **Remove** to confirm.
        
        3. To remove multiple systems from a workspace:

            a. Select the checkbox for each system you want to remove from a workspace.  

            b. Click the options icon ( <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> ) in the toolbar, then click **Remove from workspace**.

            c. Click **Remove** to confirm.

      <h4><b>Thank you for taking the time to explore workspaces!</b></h4> 

      You've now learned how to create a workspace, and how to add and remove systems from a workspace. 
      
      You can use workspaces to streamline access control for your inventory and restrict access to resources.
      
      We'd love your help developing workspaces! To join a user research session or provide feedback about your experience, click the **Feedback** button on the right side of the console.
