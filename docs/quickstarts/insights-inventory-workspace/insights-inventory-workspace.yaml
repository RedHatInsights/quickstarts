  prerequisites:
    - You are an Organization Administrator or have been granted the Workspace administrator role.

    Learn how to create a workspace, add systems to it, and remove systems from it.
  introduction: |-
    
        Welcome to the quick start for creating and managing workspaces. Workspaces provide a flexible approach to organizing your assets and streamline user access in the Hybrid Cloud Console. 
        
        Configure workspaces to organize systems in your inventory and apply access management rules to them. Use workspace configuration to restrict system access to only those who require it.
        
        In this quick start, you will:
        - Create a workspace.
        - Learn how to add systems to a workspace.
        - Learn how to remove systems from a workspace.
  
  tasks:
    - title: Create a workspace

        Workspaces provide you with an efficient way to organize your systems so that they align with your teams and lines of business. Workspaces give you additional security through role-based access control, making it easier to manage and monitor specific groups of systems based on your organizational needs.

        Create workspaces and then select specific systems to add to these workspaces to better organize your inventory. 

        You can create and manage workspaces both from **RHEL** > **Inventory** > **Workspaces**, or from **Identity & Access Management** > **Workspaces** in the console.
        
        To create a workspace:
     
        1. Go to [RHEL > Inventory > Workspaces](https://console.redhat.com/insights/inventory/workspaces) or [Identity & Access Management > Workspaces](https://console.redhat.com/iam/).
        2. Click **Create workspace**.
        3. In the **Create a workspace** dialog:
            - Enter a name for your workspace.
            - Enter a description for your workspace.
            [Currently, the parent workspace is limited to the default workspace. In upcoming releases of this feature, this setting will allow you to configure permissions inheritance.]{{admonition note}}
        4. Click **Save**.

        Your new workspace shows in the **Workspaces** list.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module

        instructions: |-
          - Is your workspace visible in the **Workspaces** list?
        failedTaskHelp: Try creating your workspace again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header

    - title: Add systems to a workspace
      description: |-

        Assigning your systems to workspaces allows you to configure access control from the workspace level. You can group your systems to fit your organizational structure, limiting permissions to users and systems by workspace.

        You can add one system to a workspace at a time, or add multiple systems to a workspace in one action from the **Systems** list or the workspace details page.

        To add one or more systems to a workspace from the  **Systems** list:

        1. Go to [RHEL > Inventory](https://console.redhat.com/insights/inventory) to see your list of systems.

        2. Select the systems you want to add to a workspace:
            
            - **To add individual systems to a workspace**, click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) next to the workspace, then click **Add to workspace**.
        
            - **To add multiple systems to a workspace**, select multiple systems using the checkboxes. Click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) in the toolbar, then click **Add to workspace**.

            [You cannot select systems that already belong to a workspace.]{{admonition note}}
        
        3. Select the workspace to add your systems to.

        You can click a workspace name to view the systems that belong to that workspace.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Does the system(s) you added appear on the workspace's page?
        failedTaskHelp: Try adding the system(s) to the workspace again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
      
    - title: Remove systems from a workspace
      description: |- 

        To remove systems from a workspace:

        1. Go to [RHEL > Inventory](https://console.redhat.com/insights/inventory) to see your list of systems and the workspaces they belong to. 

        2. To remove one system from a workspace:

            a. Click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) next to the system, then click **Remove from workspace**. 

            b. Click **Remove** to confirm.
        
        3. To remove multiple systems from a workspace:

            a. Select the checkbox for each system you want to remove from a workspace.  

            b. Click the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (options icon) in the toolbar, then click **Remove from workspace**.

            c. Click **Remove** to confirm.

        You can click a workspace name to view the systems that belong to that workspace.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Check the **Workspace** column on the **Systems** list. Do the system(s) you removed from a workspace say *No workspace*?
        failedTaskHelp: Try removing the system(s) from the workspace again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header

      <h4><b>Thank you for taking the time to explore workspaces!</b></h4> 

      You've now learned how to create a workspace, and how to add and remove systems from a workspace. 
      
      You can use workspaces to streamline access control for your inventory and restrict access to resources.
      
      We'd love your help developing workspaces! To join an upcoming user research session or provide feedback about your experience, click the **Feedback** button on the right side of the console to get in touch.
