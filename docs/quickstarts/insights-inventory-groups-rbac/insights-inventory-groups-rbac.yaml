    Learn how to create an Inventory groups, add systems to it, and remove systems from it.
  introduction: |-
    **Welcome to the quickstart for managing user access using Inventory groups to enhance security within your organization.**
    
    In this quickstart, you will use the User Access application to configure access to different Inventory groups using custom role functionality and user access groups.
    <br> <br>
    Note: By default, everyone in your organization will be assigned the "Inventory host admin" role, and will have access to all systems, whether they are grouped or not. You will change these default permissions by completing the tasks in this Quick Start.

    The scenario outlined in this Quick Start is as follows: you want to assign user-specific access to:
    - Certain groups of systems but not others, and/or
    - All ungrouped systems
