  prerequisites:
    - The system operating system must be Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or RHEL 9.
    - You must be a Malware detection administrator in the Hybrid Cloud Console and have sudo access to your RHEL system. 
    - The system must have the Insights client package installed, and be registered to Insights for RHEL.

    Install, test and run the malware detection service.
    
  introduction: |-
    To get started using the Red Hat Insights malware service, you will install YARA, the Insights client and scan your system for malware. YARA is an open-source and multi-platform tool that detects code similarities between predefined malware signatures and a scanned RHEL 
    system. If one or more conditions in a predefined signature exist on a scanned RHEL system, YARA records a malware hit on that system. If a malware issue is identified, it will be highlighted in the UI for you to proactively address with your information security team.
   
  tasks:
    - title: Install the Insights client and register your system
      description: |-    
      
        You will install YARA, the Insights client and register your system. Enter the following commands in your Command Line Interface on your RHEL system.

          1. Install YARA: 

          ```
          $ sudo dnf install yara
          ```
          2. Install the Insights client RPM:

          ```
          $ sudo dnf install insights-client
          ```
          3. Test the Insights client connection:

          ```
          $ sudo insights-client --test-connection
          ```
          4. Register the system with Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux:

          ```
          $ sudo insights-client --register
          ```
        
        After everything is successfully installed and registered, you can run the initial and full scan of the malware collection detector. 

    - title: Run the malware detection collector
      description: |-
        There are two stages of running the malware detection collector: an initial test scan and a full filesystem scan. The initial test scan of your system uses a simple test rule. The test scan is designed to verify that the installation, operation, and uploads are working 
        correctly for the malware detection service. There will be a few  matches found, but this is
        for testing purposes and nothing to act upon. 

        1. Run the Insights client malware detection collector:
        ```
        $ sudo insights-client --collector malware-detection
        ```

        The initial run creates a malware detection configuration file in 
        `/etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml`, performs a test scan, 
        and uploads the results.

        Now, you will run a full filesystem scan.
          
          2. Before performing a full filesystem scan, edit
           `/etc/insights-client/malware-detection-config.yml` with the following settings:

              a. Set the test scan option from true to false 

              `test_scan: false`

              b. Minimize scan time by setting any of the following options: 
              ```
              Filesystem_scan_only
              ```

              ```
              Filesystem_scan_exclude
              ```

              ```
              Filesystem_scan_since
              ```
              
              c. Re-run the client malware detection collector:
              ```
              $ sudo insights-client --collector malware-detection
              ```

          Once you have completed the test run and full filesystem scan, you are ready to view your results in the Insights dashboard.   

    - title: Review YARA matches in the Insights dashboard
      description: |- 
      
          1. Click **Security** in the left navigation panel. 
          2. Select **Malware** in the dropdown.
          3. You can click on **Systems** and **Signatures** to see different views.

          In most cases running a malware detection scan with YARA will result in **no signature matches**.
          If the scan does detect a match, provide the details of that match to your security incident response team.
