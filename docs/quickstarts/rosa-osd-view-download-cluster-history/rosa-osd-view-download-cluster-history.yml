  prerequisites:
    - You must have access to a managed OpenShift cluster.

  description: |-
    View and download your ROSA or OSD cluster history.
  introduction: |-
    Using OpenShift Cluster Manager, you can view the cluster notifications for your Red Hat OpenShift Service on Amazon Web Services (ROSA) or Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) clusters and download your cluster history.

    The cluster notifications detail cluster events and cluster resource changes, such as:

    - Load balancer quota updates
    - Scheduled maintenance upgrades
    - Addition or deletion of users, groups, and identity providers

    In this quick start, you'll learn how to view cluster notifications and download your cluster's entire history.

    [In this quick start, when we refer to ROSA, we are referring to both ROSA classic architecture and ROSA with HCP, and when we refer to OSD, we are referring to both OSD on GCP and OSD on AWS.]{{admonition note}}
