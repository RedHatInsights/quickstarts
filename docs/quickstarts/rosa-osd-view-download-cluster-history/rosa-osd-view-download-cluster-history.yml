  prerequisites:
    - You must have access to a managed OpenShift cluster.

    View and download your Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS or OpenShift Dedicated cluster history.
  introduction: |-
    Using OpenShift Cluster Manager, you can view the cluster notifications for your Red Hat OpenShift Service on Amazon Web Services or Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated clusters and download your cluster history.

    The cluster notifications detail cluster events and cluster resource changes, such as:

    - Load balancer quota updates
    - Scheduled maintenance upgrades
    - Addition or deletion of users, groups, and identity providers

    In this quick start, you'll learn how to view cluster notifications and download your cluster's entire history.

    [In this quickstart, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS refers to both Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS classic architecture and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, and OpenShift Dedicated refers to both OpenShift Dedicated on Google Cloud and OpenShift Dedicated on AWS.]{{admonition note}}
