  prerequisites:

    - You must be a cluster owner, cluster editor, or Organization Administrator for the cluster.
    - You must know the user identifier of the person that you want to add.

    Add OCM roles and access to cluster users.
  introduction: |-
    If you create or manage a cluster, you can add additional OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) roles and access to users of that cluster. You can specify which specific permissions you want to give these users. These permissions only apply to cluster management in OCM.

    In this quick start, you'll allow a user in your organization to manage and configure a cluster by granting them the Cluster editor role for that cluster.

    [In this quickstart, when we refer to ROSA, we are referring to both ROSA (classic architecture) and ROSA with HCP, and when we refer to OSD, we are referring to both OSD on GCP and OSD on AWS.]{{admonition note}}

  tasks:
    - title: Grant OCM role to a user in your organization
      description: |-
        To add OCM roles and grant access to users of a ROSA or OSD cluster:

        1. Go to **Cluster List**.
        1. Click your cluster's name to view the cluster details.
        1. Click the **Access control** tab.
        1. Click the **OCM Roles and Access** tab.
        1. Click the **Grant role** button.
        1. Enter the Red Hat login for the user.
        1. Select the **Cluster editor** role from the list.
        1. Click **Grant role**.

        Your cluster user now has the Cluster editor role and access for that user has now changed.

        instructions: |-
          - Does your new cluster user appear in the list of cluster administrative users for your cluster?
        failedTaskHelp: Try following the steps again.
  # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
  conclusion: |-
        Congratulations, you added OCM roles and access for your users to your cluster!

        Repeat the steps to add more OCM roles and configure access if you desire.

        If you want to remove a user you've just granted an OCM role to, click the options icon (â‹®) > Delete next to that user.
