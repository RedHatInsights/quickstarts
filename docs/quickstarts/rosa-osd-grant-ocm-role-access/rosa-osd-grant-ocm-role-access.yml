  prerequisites:
    - You must have access to a Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS or OpenShift Dedicated cluster.

    Add OCM roles and access to cluster users.
  introduction: |-
    If you create or manage a cluster, you can add additional OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) roles and access to users of that cluster. You can specify which specific permissions you want to give these users. These permissions only apply to cluster management in OCM.

    In this quick start, you'll allow a user in your organization to manage and configure a cluster by granting them the Cluster editor role for that cluster.

    [In this quickstart, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS refers to both Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS classic architecture and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, and OpenShift Dedicated refers to both OpenShift Dedicated on Google Cloud and OpenShift Dedicated on AWS.]{{admonition note}}

    - title: Grant OCM role to a user in your organization
      description: |-
        To add OCM roles and grant access to users of a Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS or OpenShift Dedicated cluster:

        1. Go to **Cluster List**.
        1. Click your cluster's name to view the cluster details.
        1. Click the **Access control** tab.
        1. Click the **OCM Roles and Access** tab.
        1. Click the **Grant role** button.
        1. Enter the Red Hat login for the user.
        1. Select the **Cluster editor** role from the list.
        1. Click **Grant role**.

        Your cluster user now has the Cluster editor role and access for that user has now changed.

        Congratulations, you added OCM roles and access for your users to your cluster!

        Repeat the steps to add more OCM roles and configure access if you desire.

        If you want to remove a user you've just granted an OCM role to, click the options icon (⋮) > Delete next to that user.
