    Connect the console to a Slack channel to receive notifications about events that have occurred. 
  introduction: |-
    Use Hybrid Cloud Console notifications to learn about events that have occurred that might impact your organization. 
    
    You can configure the console to send event notifications to various third-party applications, including Slack. You can send notifications to all users on a Slack channel, or a selected user in Slack.

    Follow this quick start to configure a Slack channel to receive event notifications when a new User Access group is created in the console. You'll also validate your configuration by sending a test event.

    [If you have any issues with the Hybrid Cloud Console integration with Slack, contact Red Hat for support from the console by clicking **?** >  **Open a support case**.]{{admonition note}}

    - title: Configure Slack to receive incoming webhooks
      description: |-
        The Slack integration uses incoming webhooks to receive event data. 
        
        Configure the incoming webhook for your integration in the [Slack webhook configuration UI](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#create-app).

        1. Create a Slack app:

          a. Click the **Create your Slack app** button to open the **Create an app** dialog.

          b. Select **From scratch**.

          c. Enter an app name and select the workspace where you want to receive notifications, and click **Create App**.

          [If you see a message about requiring approval from admins, you can request approval in the next step.]{{admonition note}}

        2. Enable incoming webhooks:

          a. Under **Features** in the left navigation, click **Incoming Webhooks**.
          
          b. Toggle the **Activate Incoming Webhooks** switch to **On**.

          c. Click **Request to Add New Webhook**. If needed, enter a message to your administrators to grant access to your app and click **Submit Request**. 

        3. Create an incoming webhook:

          a. Under **Settings** in the left navigation, click **Basic Information**.

          b. In the **Install your app** section, click **Install to Workspace**.

          c. Select a channel or user for your Slack app to post notifications and click **Allow**.

        4. (Optional) Configure how your console notifications display in Slack:

          a. Scroll down to **Display Information** and configure your app description, icon, and background color.

        5. Copy the webhook URL:

          a. Under **Features** in the left navigation, click **Incoming Webhooks**.
          
          b. Click the **Copy** button next to the webhook URL. You'll use this URL to set up the integration in the console.

        Your Slack channel is now ready to receive incoming notifications from the console.

    - title: Add the Slack integration to the Hybrid Cloud Console
      description: |-
        After you've configured an incoming webhook in Slack, you can configure the console to send event notifications to your selected Slack channel or user.

        Complete these steps in the Hybrid Cloud Console.

        1. Click **Integrations** > **Communications**.

        2. Click **Add integration**.

        3. Select **Slack** and click **Next**.

        4. Configure your Slack integration details:

          a. Enter a name for the integration, such as *My Slack notifications (#my_channel)*. You can include your Slack channel name if desired.

          b. In **Workspace URL**, paste the webhook URL that you copied from Slack and click **Next**.
          
          e. Review the integration details and click **Submit**.

        5. If needed, refresh your browser window to show your Slack integration on the **Integrations** > **Communications** page.
        
        You can now create a test notification to confirm the integration is configured correctly:

        1. Next to your Slack integration in the list, click &#8942; > **Test**.
        2. Enter a message in the **Integration Test** screen, and click **Send**. If you leave the field empty, the console sends a default message.
        3. In your Slack channel, check for your message.

        instructions: |-
          - Did you receive a test message in your Slack channel?
          - In the console, check **Notifications** > **Event Log** for the event called **Integration Test**. Does **Integration: Slack** show in a green label?


        failedTaskHelp: Try completing the steps again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages

    - title: Select notifications to send to Slack
      description: |-
        Next, configure which event notifications to send to your Slack channel. You'll complete these steps in Hybrid Cloud Console.

        Create a new behavior group in the console and select the events you want to be notified about. For this example, you'll configure notifications for when a new User Access group is created in the console. 

        [Alternatively, you can add events to an existing behavior group to be notified of. To edit a behavior group, see [Configure notification behavior groups](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console/1-latest/html-single/configuring_notifications_on_the_red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console/index#assembly-config-behavior-groups_notifications) for more information.]{{admonition note}}

        
        1. Click **Notifications** > **Configure Events**.

        2. Select the application bundle tab to find the related services you want to receive notifications for: **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**, **Console**, or **OpenShift**. For this example, select **Console** > **Behavior Groups** .

        3. Click **Create new group**:

            a. In **Behavior group name**, enter a name (for example, *Default behavior*), and click **Next**.

            b. In **Actions**, select **Integration: Slack**.

            c. In **Recipient**, select your Slack integration and click **Next**.

            d. In **Associate event types**, select the event type(s) you want to be notified about. For this example, select **Group created**, and click **Next**.

            e. Review your settings and click **Finish**.

        5. Trigger an event in the console to test the configuration. For this example, you’ll create a new User Access group to be notified of in Slack. An event will be triggered when you create a new group.

            a. Go to **Settings** > **User Access**.

            b. Click **Groups** > **Create group**.

            c. Enter a name for the group and a description, and click **Next**. 

            d. Add one or more user roles, and click **Next**. 

            e. Add members to the group, and click **Next**. 

            f. Review the user group settings, and click **Submit**.

            g. Click **Exit** to close the dialog.

        A notification is sent to your Slack channel about the new User Access group you just created.

        # - In the console: Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Communications** and check your integration in the list. Does the status in Last connection attempt report **Success**?


        failedTaskHelp: If you see a red label in **Action taken** in the console **Event Log**, check your configuration and create another test event to verify the configuration.

  conclusion: |-
    Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured the console to send notifications about selected events to your Slack channel.
    
    Next steps:
    - You can add more events to be notified about in your Slack channel by editing your behavior group from **Notifications** > **Configure Events** and assigning it more events.
    - You can configure additional Slack channels to receive additional event notifications by creating additional Slack integrations. For example, your organization may want to send certain types of notifications to different Slack channels based on your teams or security policies.
