  prerequisites:
    - You are a member of a User Access group with the Tasks administrator role. 
    - You have completed, reviewed, and addressed any issues in a pre-conversion analysis report using Red Hat Lightspeed for the systems you plan to convert.

    Convert your operating system from CentOS Linux 7 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.  
  introduction: |-  
    After running the [Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL](https://console.redhat.com/insights/learning-resources?quickstart=insights-tasks-pre-conversion) task and resolving all reported issues, use this quick start to convert your CentOS Linux 7 systems to RHEL 7.
    <br>
    <br>
    Before performing the conversion, make sure you have completed all necessary [preparation steps.](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/converting_from_an_rpm-based_linux_distribution_to_rhel/converting-using-insights_converting-from-a-linux-distribution-to-rhel)
    <br>
    <br>
    Additional information:
    
    - It is possible to convert systems from other Linux distributions. [View supported conversion paths.](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/converting_from_an_rpm-based_linux_distribution_to_rhel/con_supported-conversion-paths_converting-from-a-linux-distribution-to-rhel)

    - You can convert to RHEL using several supported methods depending on your requirements. [View supported conversion methods.](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/converting_from_an_rpm-based_linux_distribution_to_rhel/conversion-methods_converting-from-a-linux-distribution-to-rhel) 

  tasks:
    - title: Convert CentOS 7 systems to RHEL 7 using Red Hat Lightspeed
      description: |-
        [Before converting, back up your systems and verify that you can restore them if needed.]{{admonition important}}

        [To avoid serious problems after the conversion, do not convert any systems with unresolved inhibitors and warnings in the pre-conversion analysis.]{{admonition important}}

        After running the “Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL” task and resolving all reported issues, you can convert your CentOS Linux 7 systems to RHEL 7. The conversion task generates a report detailing the systems that were successfully converted and summarizing any problems for any that were not.<br>       
        
        Run the conversion task:

        1. Go to **Red Hat Lightspeed > RHEL > Automation Toolkit > Tasks.**
        1. Locate the **Convert to RHEL from CentOS Linux 7** task and click **Select systems.**
        1. You can change the task name. It will be used on the report generated. 
        1. Select the CentOS Linux 7 systems you want to convert to RHEL and click  **Next.**
        1. Configure the conversion task with the given settings, as required.
          <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbsp**Configurable task settings**</span></summary>
            - **Do not use the ELS subscription**<br>
              Choose this option if you plan to upgrade your RHEL system to version 8 or higher.
            - **Allow kernel modules outside of RHEL repositories on the system**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore kernel modules that are not part of RHEL repositories.
            - **Allow outdated kernel on the system**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore when your system is booted from an outdated kernel.
            - **Allow outdated packages on the system**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore all outdated packages on the system.
            - **Allow tainted kernel modules**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to ignore tainted kernel modules.
            - **Enable non-default RHEL repositories**<br>
              Choose this option to allow the pre-conversion analysis to install packages from the listed non-default RHEL repositories.
          </details>
        1. Click **Run Task** to start the conversion task on the selected systems.
        1. Go to the **Activity tab** and find the newly running conversion task. Your task shows a run status of "Running" until it finishes for all included systems. At that time the run status will update to "Completed."
        
        [The conversion process can take up to an hour to complete.]{{admonition note}}

    - title: Review conversion report
      description: |-
        1. Go to the **Activity tab** and find the newly generated conversion report. Select the report to view a summary of the status of each system.
        1. After task completion, you can review each system and message:<br> 
            <br>
            Each issue is assigned a severity level.
            - **Inhibitor:** The conversion failed because converting would very likely result in a deteriorated system state. This issue must be resolved before converting the affected system.
            - **Overridable inhibitor**: The conversion failed because converting would very likely result in a deteriorated system state. This issue must be resolved or manually overridden before converting.
            - **Skipped:** The conversion failed because the Conversion task could not run one or more tests. This issue must be resolved before converting the affected system.
            - **Converted:** The system has been converted. Reboot this system.
              <br>
              <br>
              1. If a system has been successfully converted with no issues, reboot the system and skip the next step.
              1. If the system was not converted, review the message for more information on the found problems and how to resolve them. Additionally, verify the following:<br>
                - You have completed all the steps to [prepare for a conversion using Red Hat Lightspeed.] (https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/converting_from_an_rpm-based_linux_distribution_to_rhel/converting-using-insights_converting-from-a-linux-distribution-to-rhel)
                - The system contains all packages required for the conversion.
                - The system is running.
                - You have resolved all issues in the Pre-conversion analysis for converting to RHEL task.

        1. After rebooting the system that has been successfully converted, remove third-party packages from the original OS that remained unchanged. These are typically packages that do not have a RHEL counterpart. To get a list of these packages, use:<br>

            ```
             # yum list extras --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=<yourrepositoryname>
            ```{{copy}}
  
        1. **Optional:** Perform an in-place upgrade to RHEL 9 to ensure your system is updated with the latest enhancements, security features, and bug fixes.<br>
        <br>
