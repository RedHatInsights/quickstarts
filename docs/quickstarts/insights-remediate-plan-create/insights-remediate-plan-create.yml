    Create and execute a remediation plan to resolve an issue detected by the Insights advisor service.
  introduction: |-
    In this quick start, you will create and execute a remediation plan on one or more systems to resolve an issue that the Insights advisor service recommends remediating.
    <br>
    <br>
    The advisor service assesses and monitors the health of your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) infrastructure and provides recommendations to address availability, stability, performance, and security issues. 
    Remediation plans use Ansible playbooks to remediate issues on systems in your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) infrastructure. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Once you've created a plan, you can execute it from within Insights on directly connected RHEL systems without additional subscriptions or tools. You can also download a remediation plan's playbook and run it in your Ansible workflow.
    <br>
    <br>
    See the [Red Hat Insights Remediations guide](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_insights/1-latest/html-single/red_hat_insights_remediations_guide/index) for more details.

  tasks:
    - title: Create a remediation plan
      description: |-
        Select an issue that the advisor service has recommended remediating on a system in your RHEL infrastructure, and then create a remediation plan to execute.

        1. On the left navigation bar, go to **Operations** > **Advisor** > **Recommendations**. 
        2. Scroll through the list of recommendations and select one whose **Remediation type** is set to **Playbook**. 
        3. Click the **Name** hyperlink to open the details of that recommendation. 
        4. On the **Conventional (RPM-DNF)** tab, select at least one system to remediate.
        5. Click the **Plan Remediation** button.

            [You must select at least one system to remediate before you can create a remediation plan.]{{admonition note}}
        </details>
        6. With the help of the wizard, create a remediation plan titled **_My-Plan-1_**, and then click **Next**. Ensure you select the **Create a playbook** option.
           6.1 Review and adjust the following items in your plan when prompted by the wizard:
            - **Systems**: Ensure the systems you want to remediate are listed.
            - **Actions**: Select the actions you want to include in your remediation plan. For some recommendations, you might be prompted to choose between multiple actions to remediate the issue.
            - **Auto reboot**: If you prefer to reboot the systems manually after the remediation plan is executed, set the **Auto reboot** toggle to off.
           6.2 When you arrive at the **Remediation review** pane, click **Submit**.
        7. To view your new plan, click **Return to application** and then go to **Automation Toolkit** > **Remediation Plans** > **My-Plan-1**.
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - When you navigate to **Automation Toolkit** > **Remediation Plans**, do you see **_My-Plan-1_**> in the table? When you open the plan, can you see the details and status of the remediation plan that you just created?

    - title: Confirm execution readiness
      description: |-
        Check that your remediation plan is ready to execute.
        [If the Execute button is enabled, this confirms that your remediation plan has passed the execution readiness check and you are ready to execute your plan! Skip these steps and proceed to the next task.]{{admonition note}}
        <br>
        <br>
        When you view the details of your remediation plan, the **Execution readiness** section will indicate why your remediation plan is not ready for execution.
         
        Ensure the prerequisites are in place so you can execute your remediation plan.

        1. Check your user access permissions to ensure you have the **Remediations administrator** RBAC role.
            [You might need to contact your organization administrator to confirm your user access settings and to apply the required permissions.]{{admonition important}}
           <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbspNeed help applying the required user access permissions?</span></summary>
            - In the console, go to **Settings** (âš™) > **User Access** > **Groups**.
            - Create a new group and then ensure that you add the **Remediations administrator** role.
            - Under **Add members**, add the user accounts that will create and execute remediation plans with Insights.</li>
           </details>
        2. Enable the Remote Host Configuration Manager (RHC) setting.
           <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbspNeed help finding the Remote Host Configuration Manager setting?</span></summary>
            - In the console, go to **Inventory** > **System Configurations** > **Remote Host Configuration (RHC)**.
            - Select **Allow permitted Insights users to execute remediation playbooks on rhc-connected systems**.
            
            For more information, see [Remote Host Configuration and Management](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_insights/1-latest/html/remote_host_configuration_and_management/index).
            
           </details>
        3. For each system that you want to remediate from within Insights, ensure you have enabled the Remote Host Configuration client (`rhc connect`) and have a direct connection to the RHEL system:
           <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbspNeed help connecting to a RHEL system?</span></summary>
            - Log on as a user with root access to the RHEL system, and execute the following commands: 
            <ol type="a">
              <li> `dnf install rhc rhc-worker-playbook`{{copy}}</li>
              <li> `dnf upgrade rhc rhc-worker-playbook`{{copy}}</li>
              <li> `grep mqtt-reconnect-delay /etc/rhc/config.toml || echo 'mqtt-reconnect-delay = "10s"' >> /etc/rhc/config.toml`{{copy}}</li>
              <li> `rhc connect`{{copy}}</li>
          </ol>
            - After executing the commands, refresh the plan details page and then check the **Connection Status** column in the **Systems** tab of your remediation plan. The status indicates whether the system is connected.
          </details>

    - title: Execute a remediation plan
      description: |-
        In this task, you will execute the remediation plan on the directly connected RHEL systems included in your plan.
        <br>
        1. Open the **Remediation plan details and status** view of **_My-Plan-1_**.
          <details>
            <summary><span style="color:#0066CC">&nbspNeed help finding your remediation plan?</span></summary>
            
            - On the console, go to **Automation Toolkit** > **Remediation Plans**.
            - Scroll through the list of remediation plans in the table and locate the remediation plan named **_My-Plan-1_** that you created earlier.
            - Click the hyperlinked name of the plan to open the **Remediation plan details and status** view.
          </details>     
        2. Click **Execute**.
        3. To view the progress of the remediation plan execution, go to the **Execution History** tab for **_My-Plan-1_**. The **Execution History** tab displays the status of the remediation playbook execution for each system and a link to the logs.
        [A remediation plan with many actions to execute on many systems might take a while to complete.]{{admonition important}}
        4. When the remediation plan is executed, return to **Operations** > **Advisor** >**Recommendations**, find and open the issue details, and then check to see if the systems you remediated are no longer listed as having the issue.
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Was your remediation plan successfully executed? Under **Advisor > Recommendations**, are the systems you just remediated no longer listed as having the issue?
