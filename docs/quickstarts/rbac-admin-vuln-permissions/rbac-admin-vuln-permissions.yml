  prerequisites:
    - You are an Organization Administrator or have User Access administrator permissions
    - (Optional) Users in your organization
  description: |-
    Grant administrative permissions for the vulnerability service to a select group of users. 
  introduction: |-
    This quick start shows you how to configure granular administrative access for the Insights for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) vulnerability service. 
    
    This will allow only your team to perform administrative tasks with the vulnerability service, like viewing and remediating security CVEs on your RHEL systems, and generating vulnerability reports.
    
    You can use this example workflow to customize access to any role within **User Access** and modify the **Default access** group.
  tasks:
    - title: Removing the Vulnerability administrator role from the **Default access** group
      description: |-
        Edit the **Default access** group and remove the roles that you don’t want all users to have. (If the **Default access** group was previously modified, then it’s called the **Custom default access** group.)
        
        For this example, remove the **Vulnerability administrator** role from the **Default access** group to revoke this access from all users in your organization.
        
        1. Click **User Access** > **Groups**.
        
        2. Click the **Default access** (or **Custom default access**) group. 
        
        3. In the **Roles** tab, find the role that you want to remove from the group – in this case, **Vulnerability administrator**.
        
        4. Next to **Vulnerability administrator**, click&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (more options) > **Remove** to revoke this permission from all users in your organization.
        
        5. Click **Remove role**.
        
        Users in your organization now no longer have **Vulnerability administrator** permissions by default. The **Default access** group is now called **Custom default access**, but any user-created group names have not changed.
        
        [You can undo any changes made to the **Default access** group by clicking **Restore to default** on the **Groups** page.]{{admonition note}}

          - Go to **Groups** > **Custom default access** and confirm that **Vulnerability administrator** is no longer in the list of roles assigned to all users in your organization.

        failedTaskHelp: Try completing the steps again.

    - title: Creating a new group and granting Vulnerability administrator permissions
      description: |-
        Create a new group with the **Vulnerability administrator** role, and assign specific team members to the group. Only the users in this group will have **Vulnerability administrator** permissions in your organization.
        
        1. Click **Groups** > **Create group**.
        2. Enter a group name (for example, *Vulnerability Admins*) and description, and click **Next**.
        3. Add the **Vulnerability administrator** role to the group.
            - You can quickly find a role by filtering by role name (type *Vulnerability*). Select the roles you want to add to the new group: in this case, select the checkbox for **Vulnerability administrator** and click **Next**.
        4. Add the Organization Administrator and any members to the group that you want to have access. Select the checkboxes for those users and click **Next**.
            - You can quickly find users by filtering by username, email, or status.
        5. Review the group details and click **Submit** to create the group.
        
        Now only the users in the *Vulnerability Admins* group have administrator permissions for the vulnerability service, but other users in your organization don't.
        
        User access in the console is additive, meaning that each user has the default access permissions, plus permissions from any other groups they are assigned.

        After completing this quick start, the Organization Administrator now has all of the roles in these groups:
        - **Default admin access**
        - **Default access**
        - *Vulnerability admins*

      # optional - the task's Check your work module
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - As the Organization Administrator in the *Vulnerability Admins* group, go to **My User Access** > **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** and confirm that **Vulnerability administrator** appears in your list of roles.

        failedTaskHelp: Try completing the steps again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
  conclusion: |-
    Congratulations! You have restricted administrative access to the vulnerability service to selected users.

    To grant additional permissions to your team, edit the group from **Groups** > *Vulnerability Admins* and add additional roles or users.
