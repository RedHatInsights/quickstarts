    Adding OCM roles and access to cluster users.
  introduction: |-
    If you create or manage a cluster, you can add additional OCM roles and access to users of that cluster. The user who created the cluster or users with specific permissions can add the OCM roles and access to a cluster.

    In this quick start, you'll add OCM roles and access to clusters for your cluster users.

  tasks:
    - title: Add OCM roles and access to your cluster
      description: |-
        To edit your cluster's name:

        1. Go to **Cluster List**.
        1. Click your cluster's name to view cluster details.
        1. Click the **Access control** tab.
        1. Click the **OCM Roles and Access** tab.
        1. Click the **Grant role** button.

        1. Select the role you want (for example, Cluster Viewer) from the list.
        1. Click **Grant role**.

        Your cluster user now has the added OCM role and access for that user has now changed.
